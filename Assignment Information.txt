TASK FREE SELECTION

DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS: https://github.com/Da-vid21/xfig-3.2.8a/issues/5

GOAL: This feature will make an icon available to select multiple objects using a 
rectangular box and move them simultaneously across the xFig main field.Two files were
added ("e_ffst.c" and "e_ffst.h") to implement the behavior of selecting multiple
objects. Your job is creating the icon, completing the functions in the new files, and
link the icon. Do not forget to include "e_ffst.h" into each file that will use it.

STEPS:
1. Open Visual Studio Code or your choice of IDE (open it from GitHub).
2. Check if you have opened the whole xfig folder.
3. Click on the search icon on the left toolbar and search "#taskFreeSelection". 
   You should see 4 files with the hashtag.
4. Use the directions provided as comments to work on the assignment.
5. Go to the desktop and compile you code double-clicking the 'compile.sh' file to check
   if your solution works.
